# The Air Quality App

Welcome to the Air Quality App! This React site uses the [IQAir Air Quality API](https://www.iqair.com/us/) to fetch data about worldwide air quality. This app makes air quality data easily accessible to users around the world.

- To quickly access your local air quality, press the "Just Show My Air Quality!" button.
- To explore air quality in cities around the world, select a country, state, and city. 
  - To undo a selection, press the blue arrow (the back button) in the upper left corner.

## Motivation

This site was created as part of [Forge](https://joinforge.co/)'s [Source](https://joinforge.co/source) course on front-end web development during the Spring 2021 session. The app was created as part of the course's social impact project, in which students were challenged to find a web API with data about an important social issue. Course members then collaborated in groups to create interactive single-page applications to display the information taken from the API's. 

## Technologies

- This application was structured primarily with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- API requests to [http://api.airvisual.com](http://api.airvisual.com) were made using JavaScript's built-in `fetch` function
